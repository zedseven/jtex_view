# jtex_view
(3DS) Picross jtex viewer

Jupiter Texture viewer.

Textures are lz-11 compressed, with a 0x80 byte header stored in a few pixel formats. This tool is a dirty implementation to view most jtex files within the game.

## Credit & Licensing
All credit goes to [kwsch](https://github.com/kwsch) for the original tool. I've only made some edits to it.

The original project had no license attached, but according to the source code it carried the same license as [pk3DS](https://github.com/kwsch/pk3DS/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
That same license has been applied to this fork.
